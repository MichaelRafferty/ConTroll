Oauth2 Server Interface

This document describes how the Oauth2 Server will call Portal to fulfill authorization and retrieve the return data

Start of an Oauth2 Validation request to ConTroll:
    Oauth2 does a redirect for the user to portal/index.php?oauth=enceypted json representation of a PHP associative array
        Contents of array:
            email: requested email for the account (who)
            retdata: what data are you asking for: Nom, Vote (case insensitive) (single value)
            returl: url call back with answer includes the variable name  (.../oauth/ret.php?oauth)  (controll appends = and encrypted string)
            apikey: defined by ConTroll and communicated to Chris)

    Controll does the appropriate redirect to oauth2 provider or sending of the email token

    On return from oauth2 privoder or click on email token:
        Controll looks up request data for returned validated email and forms reponse packet
        Redirect user via returl with the encryptred response packet which is a url encoded json representation of a php associative array

    Oauth validation request specific response packet
        common elements:
            requested email address     email

            newperson id (integer)      newperid        Note: if perid is missing, this is their id, if newperid is missing they only have a perid, if both
                                                        exist, they are the same person, but we now have assigned them their permanent id.
