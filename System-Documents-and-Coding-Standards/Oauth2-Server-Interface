Oauth2 Server Interface

This document describes how the Oauth2 Server will call Portal to fulfill authorization and retrieve the return data

Start of an Oauth2 Validation request to ConTroll:
    Oauth2 does a redirect for the user to the portal site in the config file as:  conf['portal']['redirect_base']?index.php?oauth=enceypted json representation
        e.g. https://reg.seattlein2025.org/index.php?oauth=enceypted json representation of php a associative array

        Contents of array:
QUESTION:   email: requested email for the account (who)  [Do I even need this, I never ask them for it myself, except to email a verification if login in with
email. I depend on the OAUTH2 Server to send a validated email back to me.)
            retdata: what data are you asking for: Nom, Vote (case insensitive) (single value)
            returl: url call back with answer includes the variable name  (.../oauth/ret.php?oauth)  (controll appends = and encrypted string)
            apikey: defined by ConTroll and communicated to Chris)
NEW:        app: which app is asking for authentication (NomNom, ???)  [I would like this to tell them who is asking for authetication)


    Controll does the appropriate redirect to oauth2 provider or sending of the email token

    On return from oauth2 privoder or click on email token:
        Controll looks up request data for returned validated email and forms reponse packet
        Redirect user via returl with the encryptred response packet which is a url encoded json representation of a php associative array

    Oauth validation request specific response packet
        common elements:
            requested email address     email
            validated email address     valEmail
            person id (integer)         perid
            newperson id (integer)      newperid        Note: if perid is missing, this is their id, if newperid is missing they only have a perid, if both
                                                        exist, they are the same person, but we now have assigned them their permanent id.
            response type: (value of input parameter retdata:)   resType

        Nom:
            date paid: datePaid
            legal name if allowed by privacy to send it: legalName
            full name (all of these re the prefered name): fullName
            first name; first_name
            last name: last_name
            rights: ['hugo_nominate', 'hugo_vote'] or empty array

        Vote:
            legal name if allowed by privacy to send it
            full name (all of these re the prefered name)
            first name
            last name
            rights: ['hugo_vote'] or empty array

How long should Oauth Server keep request open:
    24 hours

questions for seattle: can pending id nom/vote

Dance within portal:
    oauth2 server does a redirect to config::[portal].redirect_base   e.g. "https://reg.seattlein2025.org/index.php?oauth=..."
    index.php:
        recognizes get parameter of oauth
        decripts array and converts it back to PHP array
        Tells the user that an authentication request has come in from "app"
        If email is passed checks to see if that email is currently logged in to portal else checks if anyone is logged in to the portal
        if not logged in, asks user how they want to login and does dance with remove authenticator
            OAUTH2: mark in progress, mark for authentication response needed
            EMAIL: encodes mark for authentication response
            Reply from authentication method logs that user in
        Checks to see if that login has more than one perid (account) associated with it
            if so, asks the user which account do they wish to use for the oauth 2 request from app
                on submit, marks which perid/newperid is to be used
        else
            assigns the perid/newperid of the current login account to the request
        Accesses database to see which memberships that user has
        Builds rights response from that access
        Redirects user back to the oauth2 Server with the parameters encoded as required
