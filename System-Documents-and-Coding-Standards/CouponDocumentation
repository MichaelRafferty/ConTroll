Coupon Documentation

Coupons are used as a discount and payment item in ConTroll

This document is a work in progress and it will change as we make forward facing decisions

Coupons:
    Coupons are a marketing tool to allow for discounts to encourage people to register now (soon).

Coupon Types: enum('$off','%off','$mem','%mem','price')
    Overall Discount (Cart type items)
        $off: Fixed Dollars Off Cart - a set number of currency units (decimal 8.2) off the entire cart purchase
        %off: Fixed Percentage Off Primary Memberships in Cart - a fixed percentage (decimal 8.2) off the sum of the price of all primary memberships
                This is the same as fixe percentage off primary memberships (make patch to change this to %mem and drop from enum)

    Item Discounts (per memberships)
        $mem: Fixed Dollars Off Primary Memberships - a set number of currentcy units (decimal 8.2) off each individual primary membership line item.
        %mem: Fixed Percentage Off Primary Memberships - a fixed percentage (decimal 8.2) off each individual primary membership line item.
        price; Set Specific Membership Type to a Fixed Price - for a specific memId (membership item), set the price ot a fixed current unit (decimal 8.2)
            Note: this overrides the rules engine, and the online Y/N flag, for is a membership available for purchase by this coupon user
            //TODO check that current applied coupon in Portal actually allows membership override, an that coupon is stored in the session until payment is
                applied

Primary Membership is defined as a membership item of price > 0 AND category one of standard, supplement or virtual.
    // TODO Discuss if it's only one membership in the cart per perid/newperid (not per cart owner but the actual registration) or for any number of memberships
            of type full (Current thinking only one per person in the cart)

Coupon Limitations: A coupon can be limited to when applicable by any combination of the following (all are optional, if empty, the restriction is not applied):
    Starting date: available from (>=) this DateTime value in the timezone of the convention
    Ending date: available before (<) this DateTime value in the timezone of the convention
    Minimum number of Primary Memberships in cart
    Apply to at most (Max) times in a cart (for per primary membership type coupons only)
    Minimum cart value before discount
    Doscount maximum: Maximum coupon value
    Maximum number of redemptions: Each use of the coupon is counted, this limits how many times convention wide the coupon can be redeemed
    One Use Coupon: A set of serial numbers are assigned to a coupon.  The coupon code and an unused serial number is required (usually provided as a link) to
        use the coupon. The coupon can be assigned to a perid (for reference, not restriction, like a life member volunteer gets a coupon to hand out) and the
        the user of the coupon is recorded at redemption time.

Coupon Accounting: // TODO this is a plan for discussion, not the actual coupon method right now
    Coupons are remembered in the session until the cart is paid
    The total amount of the coupon is in the transaction record split between
            couponDiscountCart for the coupons that effect the cart ($off)
            couponDiscountReg for the coupons that effect the registration lines directly (remainder of coupons)
        such that price = paid  and sum of reg line couponDiscount = couponDiscountReg, and one one of couponDiscountCart of couponDiscountReg has a value
    The reg table has the effect of the per line item coupons as the couponDiscount with the same formula
    A payment record of type 'coupon' is recorded for the transaction for the total value of the coupon
        The description is the coupon code/name
        The nonce is 'cart', 'line' or 'membership' to indicate how the coupon was applied
    For Square:
        the coupon is an 'other' payment type
        (Note for atcon: cash, check, and discount are also 'other' payment types and will be mapped to square appropriately, nothing is entered as a discount
        in square)
        the cc amount is post the other payment type being applied
        All row items show price and paid as per the reg record
        Nothing is entered to square as a discount

Coupons are shown as payment lines on ConTroll receipts
POS Display for coupon discount
    // TODO: need to think this one out, unsure at present best way
