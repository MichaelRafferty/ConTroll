Encryption Usage

Encryption should be used for:
    Tokens - login, email, attach
    Login Strings - Redirect, account switching, email match subaccount choice
    Oauth requests/responses to the ConTroll Oauth2 Server
    Secure API parameters

Internal Encryption Standards
    There is a common library /lib/cipher.php that provides all of the key management and the routines to encrypt and descript strings.

    At present there are two different key sets in use:
        Cipher: standard encryption
        Attach: used for attaching accounts - these cross users and have a much longer lifetime

Cipher.php module:
    Internal functions:
        getLoginCipher():   sets up the cipher parameters for the standard (login) cipher keys.
        getAttachCipher():  sets up the cipher parameters for the attach cipher keys.

        Note: both of these make use of the configuration variables from the con section of the reg_conf.ini file:
            id
            label
            regadminemail

    Externally referenced functions:
        decryptCipher(string, doJson: bool) : string
            decrypts the string using the standard cipher and if doJson is true, doeas a json_decode on it to build an associative array
        decryptAttach(string, doJson: bool) : string
            decrypts the string using the attach cipher and if doJson is true, doeas a json_decode on it to build an associative array
        encryptCipher(string, doURLencode: bool) : string
            encrypts the string using the standard cipher and if doURLencode is true, performs a urlencode on the encoded string
        encryptAttach(string, doURLencode: bool) : string
            encrypts the string using the attach cipher and if doURLencode is true, performs a urlencode on the encoded string
