        atcon:      on site registration, art show, and volunteer desk Point of Sale
        controll:   administration and configuration of the ConTroll Registration System
        onlinereg:  one-shot purchase of memberships
        portal:     registration portal
        vendor:     exhibitors portal, can support multiple web endpoints (at least artist and vendor), name is historical, considering swithing it to exhibitor

    or

    Global Directory
        config:     text files for configuration of ConTroll, these are the non database table configurations
        lib:        Global ConTroll specific PHP libraries
        jslib:      Global Javascript libraries, mostly classes
        csslib:     Global CSS files
        Composer:   PHP Add-ons managed by composer.  Only the composer.json and the composer.lock files are in the git repo, vendor is in .gitignore

Each application top level has:
    css: local css files for the application
    csslib: a symlink to the top level csslib common library
    images: a gitignored local directory for clients to hold their images
    js: local javascript files for the application
    jslib: a symlink to the top level jslib common library
    lib: local php scripts used by the application main programs and also ConTroll distributed images for the application
    script: AJAX php scripts used by the application javascript files
    *.php: pages for the application
        note: these also reference the top level lib and Composer directories with require stype directives.

    there may be additional directories on an application by application basis
