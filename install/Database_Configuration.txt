            Required for each convention year (conid) to allow for changes in brackets over time
            The age type 'all' should be used for any membership type that is age independent (all is required to be in the ageList for each convention)

    Printer Configutation Tables:
        These exists in two databases

            Printer Name is the CUPS queue for this printer.
                If it starts with a 0 (as in 0B) this queue will not print, just create the temporary file on the server for diagnostics
